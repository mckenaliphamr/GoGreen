### Research question: What SNPs may be responsible for differential expression in the Wisconsin Diversity Panel. 

Task 1: Discover the genes that are most differentially expressed across the Wisconsin Diversity Panel 

     Previous studies by Hart et. al. (2013) and Wagner et. al (2012), delineate the importance of standardizing RNA-seq gene expression data. Our group chose to convert the denoted FPKM values to TPM values in order to account for gene length and sequencing depth. To normalize the TPM values across genes within each cultivar, Z score was calculated. To determine which genes were differentially expressed, the variance of zTPM scores across the 942 lines was calculated for each gene. A variance score of 45 or above was selected

Let's now say that somebody else modify this file. 


Adding in some info (Beth): I have tried to install Git locally on my computer, but have been unsucessful. I have played around on the github website and feel comfortable with making branches and submitting pull requests. 

So we add overall info here in the READ.ME correct? Then just code in our folders?

NEED TO ADD CITATIONS FOR PAPERS LISTED IN FIST PARAGRAPH
