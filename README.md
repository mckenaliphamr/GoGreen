# GoGreen

- I just edited this markdown (Erik)
- A second edition, now done locally from my PC (Erik)

A third, separate ~deleted~. E
Let's now say that somebody else modify this file. 


Adding in some info (Beth): I have tried to install Git locally on my computer, but have been unsucessful. I have played around on the github website and feel comfortable with making branches and submitting pull requests. 

So we add overall info here in the READ.ME correct? Then just code in our folders?
